## Making Contributions

### 1. Create a new branch

Before starting any work, create a new branch off the main branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make your changes

Write clean and modular code following our project structure and coding standards.

### 3. Commit your changes
Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your feature or fix"
```

### 4. Push to your branch
Push the changes to your branch on your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. Create a Pull Request
Create a Pull Request (PR) to the main repository. Fill out the PR template with relevant details about your changes.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with the main repository before making a PR:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

3. Once your branch is up to date, resolve any conflicts if they arise.

2. Test your changes before submitting a PR to make sure everything works as expected.

3. PRs should be small and focused. Avoid bundling multiple features or fixes into a single PR.
